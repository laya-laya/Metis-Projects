### Metis project3: Predicting ADHD diagnosis from brain connectivity.



To download the data, run `chmod +x download_data.sh`, then `./download_data.sh`, then `unzip data.zip`.



There are many notebooks, each for a different set of experiments. Each notebook has text at the top that explains what experiments were done in the notebook and the outcomes.


To reproduce the results, run the notebooks in the order they are numbered. The un-numbered notebooks are other experiments not necessary for the final results.

Make sure that the variables in the first notebook were saved to pickle files (the lines that save the variables may be set to False); these are loaded in the second notebook.
